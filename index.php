            <h4>Open University of Tanzania History</h4>
            The Open University of Tanzania (OUT) (Swahili: Chuo Kikuu Huria cha Tanzania)
            is a distance learning public university in Tanzania and the largest by the
            number of students.[2] It was established by an Act of Parliament No. 17 of 1992.
            It is a single mode institution offering certificate, 
            diploma and degree courses through distance learning.

            <h4>About University</h4>
            Studyportals began as a spin-off from a couple of large international study associations.
            It was born out of frustration, a total lack of information and overview of the fast-growing
            number of international Masterâ€™s programmes in Europe. In 2007, Mastersportal.com was developed
            and proved to be a roaring success. Soon after, Bachelorsportal.com, PhDportal.com, 
            Shortcoursesportal.com, and Distancelearningportal.com followed.

In 2021, we helped 52 million students around the world to explore study programmes and make an informed choice, throughout over 200,000 courses at 3,750+ educational institutes across 110 countries.
